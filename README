This is the CloudFlare Go repository. We try to follow mainline as close
as possible but will backport safety critical bug fixes and low-impact
performance patches.

If you need to update the git repository, you can run the update.sh
script. This will clone the official Google Go mercurial repo and import
the changes into the git repo. The upstream branches will be imported
with the prefix upstream.
